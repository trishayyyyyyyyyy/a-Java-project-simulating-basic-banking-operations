# 🏦 Java Bank Simulation – Lab 6

This project simulates a basic banking system in Java, allowing users to perform operations on an account while demonstrating key object-oriented concepts such as:

- Class and object usage
- Exception handling
- Encapsulation and abstraction

## 📁 Files Included

- `Account.java` – Represents a bank account with balance and operations.
- `BankOperations.java` – Contains the main method and simulates deposit/withdrawal operations.
- `InsufficientFundsException.java` – A custom exception class for handling overdrafts.
- `lab6.69757.trishgumbo.txt` – Supplementary information or lab instructions.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (Console-based)
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Custom exception handling

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the files in a Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.).
3. Compile and run the `BankOperations` class.
